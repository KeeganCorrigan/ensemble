## Ensemble

This a music collaboration app hosted on Heroku. It is meant to be used on a mobile device and is not styled or tested on a full size monitor.

### testing

To run the test suite, run:

```
=> bundle
=> rspec
```

### database stuff

A seed file is included with this, before running, I recommend:

```
rake db:{drop,create,migrate,seed}
```

that way you can start fresh.
